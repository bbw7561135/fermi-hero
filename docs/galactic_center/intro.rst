   Fermi LAT count maps of the Galactic plane (GLON = -180 deg to +180 deg, GLAT = -10 deg to +10 deg),
   smoothed with a Gaussian of 0.5 deg width in the energy bands 0.1 -- 1 -- 10 -- 100 -- 1000 GeV
   (top to bottom).

Our goal in this tutorial is to reproduce this image:

   :scale: 70 %

   Fermi LAT source excess maps (counts / deg^2, smoothed with a Gaussian of 0.27 deg width)
   of the Galactic plane in the energy range 10 GeV to 316 GeV.
   Galactic and isotropic diffuse emission as well as known sources that have been identified as blazars are subtracted.
