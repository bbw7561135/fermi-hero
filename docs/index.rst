Fermi Hero
==========

Welcome to the `Fermi <http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov>`_ Large Area Telescope (LAT) data analysis tutorial for the 
`2013 IMRPS summer school on high energy astrophysics <http://www.mpia.de/imprs-hd/SummerSchools/2013/>`_!

.. warning:: This webpage is work in progress, please don't go through the tutorial material yet.

             All you have to do before the tutorial is install some software and download some Fermi data
             on your laptop, which will take you about an hour if you have a fast internet connection. 

             A new version of the Fermi software and data will be released in the first
             week of September 2013, so we want you to get set up only shortly before the tutorial, not now. 

The tutorial will be held by Christoph Deil and Victor Zabalza from
`MPIK Heidelberg <http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/mpi/en/start/>`_
on Tuesday (September 10), 4 to 5:30 pm
and Thursday (September 12), 4 to 7 pm.

If you have any question, please post them in this `forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gammapy_enrico>`_.
Don't be shy ... really any question is welcome ...installation issues, error messages, science questions ...

If you are comfortable using `GitHub <https://github.com>`_ to report issues or contribute improvements via pull requests,
you can find the repository for this tutorial `here <https://github.com/gammapy/fermi-hero/>`_.
