Fermi LAT data analysis tutorial @ 2013 IMRPS summer school on high energy astrophysics

.. warning:: This webpage has not been set up yet. Please come back later.

Schedule:

* Tuesday (September 10), 4 to 6 pm
* Thursday (September 12), 4 to 6 pm

Outline:

* Intro to Fermi and gamma-ray data analysis (Christoph or Victor?)
* Image (Christoph): high-energy all-sky count map; look at Fermi bubbles and maybe other sources using 2FGL region file (gtbin, ds9)
* Spectrum (Christoph?): Crazy diamond AGN 3C 454.3; likelihood model fit with gtlike. (use enrico or one of the other Python wrapper scripts?)
* Lightcurve (Victor): Crab nebula with aperture photometry

Other ideas:

* SED modeling / fitting with gammafit?
* Compute Crab spectrum (maybe too complicated with the three components?)
* Compute significance / trial factors for claimed dark matter annihilation emission lines
* Briefly (15 min total) introduce / highlight some other very useful Python packages? (ipython, numpy, scipy, astropy, scikit-image, scikit-learn)
