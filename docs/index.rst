Welcome to the `Fermi <http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov>`_ Large Area Telescope (LAT) data analysis tutorial for the 
`2013 IMRPS summer school on high energy astrophysics <http://www.mpia.de/imprs-hd/SummerSchools/2013/>`_!

The tutorial will be held by Christoph Deil and Victor Zabalza from
`MPIK Heidelberg <http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/mpi/en/start/>`_.

If you have any question, please post them in this `forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gammapy_enrico>`_.
Don't be shy ... really any question is welcome ...installation issues, error messages, science questions ...

* Tutorial pages: http://fermi-hero.readthedocs.org
* Tutorial data: will be distributed with USB sticks on Monday ... after the tutorial we'll put a tarball online to get it.
