Fermi Hero
==========

Welcome to the `Fermi <http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov>`_ Large Area Telescope (LAT) data analysis tutorial for the 
`2013 IMRPS summer school on high energy astrophysics <http://www.mpia.de/imprs-hd/SummerSchools/2013/>`_!

The tutorial will be held by Christoph Deil and Victor Zabalza from
`MPIK Heidelberg <http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/mpi/en/start/>`_.

* Monday, September 9, 17:00 - 18:00: Victor will give a 15 minute introduction to Fermi (`link to slides <https://raw.github.com/gammapy/fermi-hero/master/slides/introduction.pdf>`_).
  Then we'll do the :ref:`software` and :ref:`data` setup.
* Tuesday, September 10, 16:00 - 17:30: :ref:`getting_started` tutorial
* Thursday, September 12, 16:00 - 19:00: :ref:`galactic_center` tutorial, :ref:`spectrum`,
  and if we are quick the  :ref:`lightcurve`.

If you have any question regarding the use of ``enrico``, please post them in this `forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gammapy_enrico>`_.
Don't be shy ... really any question is welcome ...installation issues, error messages, science questions ...

* Tutorial pages: http://fermi-hero.readthedocs.org
* Tutorial data: will be distributed with USB sticks on Monday ... after the tutorial we'll put a tarball online to get it.

The tutorial pages are generated from the `fermi-hero Github repository <https://github.com/gammapy/fermi-hero/>`_,
just in case you'd like to contribute corrections or improvements.

.. warning:: Please **do not** download large files during the tutorial or the WIFI network will overload.
   We will distribute the software and data you need via USB sticks.
   
.. warning:: In September 2013 a new version of the Fermi science tools and re-processed Pass 7 data was announced to be released.
   We will update this tutorial when this happens.
